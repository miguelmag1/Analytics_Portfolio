This project is divided into three sections, that describes below:
1. User visualization that answer "What would be the number of clients that would be part of the campaign month by month?".
2. The loyalty team is in the initial phase of creating a reactivation strategy whose objective is to encourage the use of 
the products offered by the company. The campaign will be aimed at those customers who show inactivity. For this exercise is necessary to respond to this question
"How can I create a strategy that encourages the use of my products focused on the characteristics of my clients?". To answer this question is necessary to apply
the KNN methodology in December 2013 clients, through a decision tree assigned the cluster to June 2014 clients, and evaluated the change of cluster between this month.
3. In this section the objective is to answer this question "Which customers should be included in the loyalty strategy for the next three months in order to encourage 
the use of the products offered by the company?". To answer this question is necessary to use the sliding window technique and to create different models (decision tree, 
logistic regression, etc) that forecast the behavior of the clients in December month, previously to apply the models in September month. It should be noted that the models 
were previously created and tested with the data for the months of April, May, and June.
